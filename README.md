# SC 3260/5260 Private Repository

This is your personal private repository that only you 
and I (the instructor) have access to. Assignments will 
be submitted by push your code, build scripts, and other
relevant files to this repository in GitHub. Please create
a separate sub-directory for each assignment.

*****  HWK1: *****
Hi! In this REPO, you will notice a HWK1 dir containing HW1_part1 & HWK1_part2, 
containing all the relevent (modified) files.  For the question answers and
the plots please see dir:[assignments-chasonchason/hwk1/submission_materials].
You will find FOUR plots & FOUR txt files. The plots, for TIME and FLOPS
are in both LOG and LINEAR (y-axis). The txt files contain the answers to 
all questions, and the TABLES for the times and the FLOP counts and the 
compiler time results for part 1.   
   Thanks,
   Nicholas Chason
